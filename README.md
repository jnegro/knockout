**KNOCKOUT!**

A Text-based game to show beginner programs how objects have
attributes and methods using Python

Programming is like writing sentences.  In a sentence you have have
Nouns, Verbs and Adjectives, as well as Proper Nouns, like someone's
name. In what we call "Object-Oriented  Programming", we have the
same things.

_Objects_

Objects are Proper Nouns.  They describe a particular Person, Place,
or Thing by name.  For the example, let's say YOU are the object.

_Classes_

Classes are Nouns.  They describe a type of person place of thing.  
YOU, the Object, are of the HUMAN class

_Attributes_

Attributes are Adjectives.  They describe HUMANS like YOU.  HUMAN
attributes include Height, Weight, Eye Color, etc.

_Methods_

Methods are Verbs.  They are actions that HUMANS like YOU can do, 
like Move, Talk, or Eat.

_Property Methods_

Property methods are attributes that are determined by a calculation. 
For instance, a HUMAN like YOU has a Birthday attribute that is always
the same, and an Age attribute that is always increasing as time 
passes.  A HUMAN's Age must always be calculated at that moment.

**The Code**

Our code example is written in Python, which is a popular, 
multi-purpose programming language that professionals use every day
to build software for websites, robotics and much more.  It is 
written and maintained by hundreds of people around the globe and is free for
anyone to use.  Python comes pre-installed on MacOS computers, and
can be installed on Windows computers as well.  More information
and downloads can be found at http://www.python.org

Here are some Python basics that will help you understand our 
example code:

1) The indentations, or spaces, at the beginning of lines of code
are very important in Python.  They decide the what parts of the 
code happen inside other parts of the code. For instance, if you
start a "while" loop, everything you want to repeat must be 
indented under the beginning of the loop.

2) In Python, functions and methods start with "def".

3) Like most programming languages, Python code does not run every
line of code it sees in order.  In our example, you'll see the "Boxer"
class defined near the top of the program, as well as the 'main' function.
Nothing actually happens with the program though until a function is actually
run.   In our case, the first code that actually runs in the application
is when we start the main() function at the end of the file.

**Running the Code**

Once you have the code in a file, you can run it from command line on
any computer that has Python installed.  On MacOS, open the Terminal application
in Applications/Utilities. In Windows, open the Command Prompt. In 
the directory where the program file is, run:

    python knockout.py
    
**Why Python and Not Scratch?**

Scratch is a programming language commonly used in elementary 
education to teach basic fundamentals of coding.  While it 
may be good for sparking a general interest, it can be too simplistic
for kids looking to take the next step.  Python is a robust 
programming language used in the real world, with a vibrant online 
community.  It can be used to make web applications, program robotics
projects, and has extensive use cases on DIY project platforms like
the Raspberry Pi.  If you or your child has a real interest in coding,
Python is a capable, approachable language that you can use for almost 
any project.
